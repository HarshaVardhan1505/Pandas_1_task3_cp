# Flipkart E-commerce Data Analysis using Pandas

This project involves analyzing an e-commerce dataset from Flipkart using Python's Pandas library. The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset, including data exploration, summary statistics, and basic data manipulation techniques. 

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate basic data analysis skills using Pandas. The tasks include:
- Exploring the dataset using Pandas methods (`head()`, `tail()`, `info()`, `describe()`)
- Renaming columns for better readability
- Performing additional data manipulations as needed

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Display the first few records (`head`) and the last few records (`tail`) to get an initial overview of the dataset.
- **Dataset Summary**: Use `info()` and `describe()` methods to get a summary of the dataset, including data types and basic statistics.
- **Custom Data Viewing**: Allow the user to specify how many records to view with `head` and `tail`.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Rename columns for better clarity and perform other data manipulation tasks.
